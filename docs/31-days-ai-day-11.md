# Day 11: The Professional's Compass: Core Principles Every AI User Needs

## The Reality Check: Tactics vs. Principles

You have learned CRIT, you understand tokens, and you can debug with AI. All of that is useful, but none of it is permanent. Models evolve, interfaces shift, and the specific tricks that work today may not work a year from now.

If you only collect tactics, you are always chasing the next change. If you learn the underlying principles, you can adapt to whatever shows up next.

Think of this as your compass. When the map changes, the compass still points north.

## Mental Models: The Core Compass

### 1. The Amnesiac Expert

**The concept:** Working with an AI is like briefing a world class expert who has complete amnesia.
**The implication:** They have deep knowledge about the world, but they remember nothing about you, your project, or even your last message unless you explicitly provide it.
**The rule:** Treat every new chat like a fresh brief. Supply all essential context up front.

### 2. The Golden Rule of Prompting

**The concept:** Better context produces better predictions.
**The implication:** An AI is a prediction engine. It selects the next word based on the words you give it.
**The rule:** Sparse or sloppy context leads to weak predictions. Rich, structured input produces strong, reliable output.

### 3. The Proportionality Principle

**The concept:** Risk management.
**The rule:** Match your level of oversight to the stakes.

* **Low stakes (brainstorming):** Light oversight. Let the AI run.
* **High stakes (legal, code, compliance):** Heavy oversight. Validate everything carefully.

## The Workflow: Building Professional Habits

Principles matter, but habits are what make them practical. These blocks help you operationalize your compass.

### Block 1: The Smarter Search Engine

**When/Why:** Use AI to synthesize information so you do not have to sift through multiple search results.
**The pattern:**

```text
Role: [Expert Field]
Task: Explain [Concept] to me like I'm a [Your Role]. Give me 3 key takeaways and one concrete example.
```

**The steps:**

1. Identify the gap you need to close.
2. Ask for an explanation tailored to your role, context, or project.
3. Cross check important details using the Proportionality Principle.

### Block 2: Weekly Experiments

**When/Why:** Regular experimentation keeps your prompting skills sharp.
**The pattern:**

```text
Goal: Try one new prompting technique (e.g., Chain of Thought, Role-Playing) every week.
```

**The steps:**

1. Choose a technique, such as “argue from the opposite.”
2. Apply it to a real task or challenge.
3. Capture what happened. Did it help? Would you use it again?

### Block 3: Naming Conversations

**When/Why:** Clear names keep the “amnesiac expert’s” context organized over multiple sessions.
**The pattern:**

```text
Action: Rename every chat session to something descriptive immediately.
Example: "Project X - Marketing Copy - Draft 1"
```

**The steps:**

1. Start a session.
2. Give it a descriptive name right away.
3. Keep working in that same thread rather than creating new chats for the same project.

## Caution: The Limits of the Analogy

There are things you should never hand off entirely.

**Do NOT outsource:**

* **Common sense:** The amnesiac expert can sound confident even when it is wrong.
* **Ethics:** The AI has no moral grounding. It reflects whatever you feed it.

## The Tri-Stage Checklist

### Before

* [ ] **Context check:** Have you properly briefed the amnesiac expert?
* [ ] **Stakes check:** Do the risks require full verification?

### During

* [ ] **Context maintenance:** Are you staying in the same chat to preserve continuity?
* [ ] **Golden rule:** Are you giving enough context to drive accurate predictions?

### After

* [ ] **Oversight:** Did you review the output with rigor that matches the stakes?
* [ ] **Habit check:** Did you name the conversation?

## Closing Activation

**Name your conversations.**
Open your AI tool and scan your recent chats. If they are labeled “New Chat” or “Untitled,” rename the last few to something clear and descriptive. Treat your workspace like an organized archive rather than a digital junk drawer.
