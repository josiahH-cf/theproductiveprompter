# Day 21: 7 Quick Wins: Instant Upgrades for Your Prompts

## The Reality Check: Sometimes You Just Need a Quick Fix

We’ve covered the deeper work already, from CRIT to token management. That’s the part that builds lasting skill. But every now and then, you just need a fast improvement. You’re short on time, you don’t want to craft a perfect prompt, and you simply want something better than the mediocre answer you just got.

## Mental Models: The Cheat Codes

These aren’t full frameworks. They’re cheat codes, quick levers you can pull to immediately upgrade your output with almost no overhead.

## The Workflow: 7 Instant Upgrades

### Win 1: The “Act As” Hack

**Why:** If you don’t define a role, the model defaults to “generic assistant,” which tends to be bland and unfocused.
**The Pattern:** Start your prompt with `Act as a [World-Class Role].`
**Example:** “Act as a Senior Python Architect.” is clearer and more forceful than “Help me with code.”

### Win 2: The “Show Me” Rule

**Why:** Without structure, the model rambles.
**The Pattern:** End your prompt with `Format your answer as a [Specific Format].`
**Example:** “Format your answer as a markdown table with columns for Pros, Cons, and Cost.”

### Win 3: The “Explain Like I’m 5” (ELI5)

**Why:** Dense explanations slow you down.
**The Pattern:** `Explain [Complex Topic] to me like I'm 12 years old. Use an analogy.`
**Example:** “Explain Kubernetes like I’m 12.”

### Win 4: The “Devil’s Advocate”

**Why:** You’re biased toward your own ideas.
**The Pattern:** `I am thinking of doing [X]. Act as a critic and tell me 3 reasons why this is a terrible idea.`
**Example:** “I’m thinking of rewriting my app in Rust. Tell me why I shouldn’t.”

### Win 5: The “Refusal” Check

**Why:** Models often guess instead of admitting uncertainty.
**The Pattern:** `If you don't know the answer, say "I don't know." Do not guess.`
**Example:** “What is Apple’s current stock price? If you don’t have live access, say so.”

### Win 6: The “Code Converter”

**Why:** You know one language but need output in another.
**The Pattern:** `Translate this [Language A] code to [Language B]. Explain the key differences.`
**Example:** “Translate this Java class to Python dataclasses.”

### Win 7: The “Chain of Thought” Lite

**Why:** The model will make logical or numerical mistakes if you only ask for the answer.
**The Pattern:** `Think step-by-step.`
**Example:** “How many tennis balls fit in a bus? Think step-by-step.”

## Caution: The Shortcut Trap

These patterns boost quality fast, but they don’t replace deeper work.

**Don’t outsource:**

* **Deep thinking:** These are quick fixes, not substitutes for real design or architecture.
* **Verification:** Step-by-step reasoning helps, but it doesn’t guarantee correctness.

## The Tri-Stage Checklist

### Before

* [ ] **Goal Check:** Do I need a full framework or just a quick upgrade?

### During

* [ ] **Application:** Did I assign a Role? Did I specify a Format?

### After

* [ ] **Review:** Did the cheat code meaningfully improve the answer?

## Closing Activation

**Try three today.**
Pick any three of these quick wins and use them in your next interactions. You’ll see the difference immediately.
