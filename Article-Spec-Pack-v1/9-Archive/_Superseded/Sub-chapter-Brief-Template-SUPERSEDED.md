# Superseded: Sub-chapter Brief Template

**Original File:** `Sub-chapter Brief Template (Focused Spec).md`  
**Superseded Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Replacement:** `Article-Brief-Template.md` (in `2-Templates/`)

---

## Reason for Superseding

This template was designed for the **chapter-oriented workflow** where chapters were divided into sub-chapters with internal movements and stop-points. The article-oriented workflow uses a **single-pass approach** without chapter/sub-chapter architecture.

**Key differences:**
- Articles have no sub-chapter hierarchy
- Single Article Brief handles all planning (no separate sub-chapter briefs needed)
- No movement coordination or transitional bridges required
- Article Brief includes all necessary planning fields (objectives, device activation, freshness expectations)

---

## What Replaced This

**Article-Brief-Template.md** serves the planning function for complete articles:
- Objective & scope (similar to sub-chapter objective)
- Core argument with supporting claims (similar to local thesis + core moves)
- Device activations (explicit name/purpose/placement)
- Freshness expectations (dynamic, topic-specific)
- Success criteria and evaluation checks

---

## Historical Use

This template was used to create focused specifications for sub-chapters requiring:
- Heavy data or statistics with APA citations
- Complex original analogies or case studies
- Multiple narrative device integrations
- Mission-critical topics needing airtight logic

In the article workflow, these requirements are handled directly in the Article Brief.
