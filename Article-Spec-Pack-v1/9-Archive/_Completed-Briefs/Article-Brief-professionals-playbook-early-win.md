## 1. Article Metadata

**Title:**  
The Professional's Playbook: Four Role-Specific Prompt Templates for an Early Win

**Intended Audience:**  
Practitioners using AI at work — software developers (Python/JS), project managers, creative strategists, and self‑guided learners; comfortable with Markdown and basic prompt patterns.

**Publication Context:**  
Companion article in The Practical Prompting Playbook series; public-facing standalone piece linked from the book’s site.

**Estimated Scope:**  
Hands‑on templates for four roles with short scenarios, anatomy breakdowns, and usage notes. Excludes deep theory; focuses on copy‑paste readiness and immediate application.

---

## 2. Objective & Scope

**Objective:**  
Give readers four production‑ready prompt templates (Developer, Project Manager, Creative, Learner), each introduced by a relatable scenario and followed by an anatomy breakdown (Role, Task, Context, Format) so readers can adapt them confidently.

**Scope:**  
- IN: Short setup vignette per role; one prompt template per role; anatomy breakdown; quick usage tips and pitfalls; optional link‑based citations if claims are made.
- OUT: Long‑form theory of prompting; vendor/tool endorsements; exhaustive persona variants; APA‑heavy references unless a claim requires it.

**Constraints:**  
~1,500–2,000 words; second‑person practitioner voice; link‑based citations by default; no internal scaffolding labels in public text; reflowable Markdown; end with verification/next action.

## 3. Core Argument

**Central Thesis:**  
Structured, role‑specific prompt templates convert vague requests into repeatable results by making role, task, context, and format explicit.

**Supporting Claims:**
- Role specification reduces ambiguity and aligns outputs with professional expectations.
- Explicit task and success criteria cut revision loops and time‑to‑final.
- Context windows and input placeholders prevent hallucinations and off‑target answers.
- Output format directives enable direct handoff to tools (tables, code blocks).

## 4. Planning Aids (Internal Behaviors)
- Scenario/vignette: Open each section with a 2–3 sentence problem vignette matching the role (Alex/Maya/Leo/Sam).
- Q&A subheading: “How to adapt this template” — 3 bullets on tailoring Role/Task/Context/Format.
- Prompt plate: One code‑fenced template per role with clear placeholders.
- Decision checklist: Short list of when to tighten/loosen constraints.

## 5. Freshness Expectations

**Time-Sensitive Topics:**  
If citing tooling success metrics or enterprise studies, prefer sources within 12–18 months.

**Stable Topics:**  
Foundational prompt structure patterns; general writing/clarity guidance.

**Research Gaps:**  
If no neutral benchmark exists for a claimed improvement, phrase as practitioner guidance and link to community write‑ups rather than stats.

**Companion-Site Policy:**  
Prefer trend descriptions and linkable sources; avoid hard numbers that may stale quickly.

## 6. Success Criteria
- [ ] Each role includes: vignette → template → anatomy → adaptation tips.
- [ ] All templates are copy‑pasteable and runnable; placeholders are obvious.
- [ ] Ends with a verification step and a concrete next action.
- [ ] Tables and code blocks render cleanly in Markdown (reflowable).
- [ ] No internal scaffolding terms leak into the public text.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

**Risks:**
- Over‑generic templates that don’t translate to real work contexts.
- Drift into tool/vendor specifics implying endorsement.

**Assumptions:**
- Readers can edit Markdown and provide their own inputs (code, requirements, skills).
- Readers have basic familiarity with LLM usage and paste workflows.

## 8. Integration Notes

**Cross-References:**  
Link back to the series intro (“Beyond the Hype”) and forward reference to deeper chapters on structure and critique.

**Tone Adjustments:**  
Keep the Default Style Anchor cadence (clarity, evidence, purposeful sentences). Prefer gently directive language.

**Special Instructions:**  
Add a bold two‑sentence disclaimer upfront noting templates are educational and must be reviewed by qualified professionals before production use.
