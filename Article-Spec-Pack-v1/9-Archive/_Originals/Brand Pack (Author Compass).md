## Brand Voice
- Neutral, precise, and evidence-led.
- Third person by default; first person only if explicitly briefed.
- No metaphors, slogans, or "it isn't x but y" unless the brief explicitly demands them.

## Relationship to Other Documents
**Precedence Rule:**  
When conflicts arise, resolve them in this exact order:

1. Style Baseline (Directive)
2. Brand Pack (Author Compass)
3. Chapter Brief
4. Sub-chapter Brief
5. Critic Loop
6. Citations & IP Note
7. Narrative Devices

This order is binding and must be logged if a conflict is resolved.

---

## Device Policy
- Activate a device **only if** a Chapter or Sub-chapter Brief explicitly **names the device and states its purpose**.  
- If no activation key is present, all devices must remain excluded.

---

## Integration with Drafting Process
- At the start of any draft, **declare one hard shape** from Shape Set A (defined in the Global Header) and follow it end-to-end.  
- Ensure each paragraph is formed well in the whole of the chapter. Ensure there is no other repeating information in the rest of the chapter.
- Maintain APA 7 in-text citation and consolidated references for all non-common-knowledge claims.
- Apply the Critic Loop only after the draft is complete to normalize tone without adding new facts.
- The whole of the chapter should be considered in the writing process - each part necessary and unrepeated.

---

## Freshness Gate
If a draft contains a **time-sensitive claim** (for example: market size, adoption rate, or regulation update),  
**trigger a Research Pass** to find a current citation or insert a bracketed note:

> “[Writer to research latest <topic/>]”

---

## Enforcement
- All outputs are checked against: Style Anchor Card presence, declared shape adherence, final-line verification, device activation key, and freshness gating.
- Failure on any check stops publication until corrected.
