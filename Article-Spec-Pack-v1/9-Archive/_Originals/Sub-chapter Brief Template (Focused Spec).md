### When to Use

Create a Sub-chapter Brief when **any** of the following apply:

- The section includes **heavy data or statistics** requiring APA citations and fresh sourcing.
- The section needs **complex, original analogies** or case studies beyond the main chapter’s flow.
- Multiple **narrative devices** (Prompt Plates, Decision Trees, What the Papers Say) must be integrated and coordinated.
- The topic is **mission-critical** to the book’s thesis and demands airtight logic and length.

If a sub-chapter is a straightforward explanation or narrative extension, rely on the Chapter Brief alone.

### Template Fields and Guidance

Each Sub-chapter Brief is a concise but directive instruction set for the model.  
Fill out each field in clear, actionable language.

---

#### 1. Objective

- **Definition:** The transformation or takeaway for the reader in this specific sub-chapter.
- **Guidance:** State in one or two sentences.
- **Example:**
  > “Demonstrate how billions of iterative corrections enable an AI model to learn statistical relationships among tokens.”

---

#### 2. Local Thesis

- **Definition:** The sub-chapter’s central argument or claim.
- **Guidance:** Make this a single, unambiguous sentence that ties back to the chapter’s Local Thesis.
- **Example:**
  > “Training a model is less about teaching concepts and more about compressing probabilities into a statistical map of language.”

---

#### 3. Core Moves

List the key narrative steps the sub-chapter will take to fulfill its Objective and Local Thesis.  
Each bullet starts with an action verb and specifies the method.

Examples:

- “Open with a vivid real-world analogy that grounds the concept of ‘training data’.”
- “Integrate a five-step bolded structure inside the narrative (Data Collection → Task → Error Correction → Learning at Scale → Deployment).”
- “End with a crisp one-paragraph summary linking back to the chapter’s main argument.”

---

#### 4. Required Artifacts

Detail any mandatory elements the draft must include:

- **Reflowable tables or diagrams** (Kindle/EPUB3 compatible, never images).
- **Prompt Plates, Decision Trees, What the Papers Say** boxes, if needed.
  - **Activation header required when any device is used:**  
    `Device: {Prompt Plate | Decision Tree | What the Papers Say} — Purpose: {verbatim from brief}`
- **Cross-reference boxes** linking to other parts of the book (e.g., to the chef analogy in a different chapter).
- **Citation requirements** (e.g., specific papers, current industry data).

State purpose and function, not just format, so each artifact serves the argument.

---

#### 5. Transitional Bridge

Provide one or two sentences describing the intended transition to the next sub-chapter or back to the main chapter narrative.  
Example:

> “Close by connecting the model’s training journey to its real-time inference process, setting up Section 5.3 on how models ‘think’ at runtime.”

### Integration & Execution Rules

1. **Loading order for drafting**
   - Style Baseline (Directive)
   - Brand Pack (Author Compass)
   - Parent Chapter Brief
   - This Sub-chapter Brief
   - Critic Loop

2. **Drafting behavior**
   - Model writes the sub-chapter to natural book length (typically **1,500–4,000 words**, depending on complexity).
   - **Movements**: If expected length exceeds ~2,500 words, propose internal movements (≈700–1,200 words each) with named purposes before drafting to support context-window management and movement-level review.
   - **Hard shape**: Declare **one** approved hard shape from Shape Set A **at the top of the draft** and follow it end-to-end.
   - **Final line**: End the sub-chapter with a **verification or next-action sentence**, never a maxim.
   - **Devices OFF by default**: Integrate narrative devices **only** when this brief **names the device and states its purpose**; include the **Activation header** line directly before the device.
   - **Freshness gate**: For any time-sensitive claim, perform a **Research Pass** to add a current citation or insert **[Writer to research latest topic]**.
   - Applies the **Critic Loop** at the end: checks voice, focus, evidence, then performs one silent revision before returning text.
   - Uses **APA in-text citations** and updates the parent chapter’s **consolidated reference list**.

3. **Relationship to the Chapter Brief**
   - The Sub-chapter Brief inherits all style and stance requirements from the Brand Pack and Style Baseline.
   - It **expands** but does not **override** the parent Chapter Brief’s Objective or Local Thesis.

### Quick Reference: What This Template Solves

- Prevents underwritten or off-tone sections when a topic is complex.
- Enables precise integration of analogies, tables, or decision trees.
- Ensures consistent voice and argument continuity across lengthy chapters.
