### 1. Narrative Voice

- **Third-person only** — no first-person or “we/you” unless quoting a source.
- **Authorial stance** — confident, plain-spoken, instructive, objective, engaging, direct, optimistic, genuine
- **Style Anchor binding** — A **100–150 word Style Anchor Card** must be present and applied to cadence and lexicon; if missing, halt and request the card before drafting.

### 2. Tone & Cadence

- **Direct and concise** — state the point, then back it up with facts or show the reader how it's true.
- **Sentence variety** — natural rhythm with a mix of short punchy statements and medium-length explanations (approx. 16–22 words on average, but no mechanical counting).
- Natural voicing - Feels like a human wrote it.
- **Paragraphs** — self-contained ideas, typically 80–110 words. Natural sounding sentences that build arguments throughout the chapter.

### 3. Clarity & Density

- **Written with intent** — every sentence must advance the idea, provide evidence, strengthen arguments, or set up a transition.
- **Concrete over abstract** — favor specific examples and verifiable facts over vague generalities.  
  If facts need research, insert **[Writer to research topic]**.

### 4. Evidence & Attribution

- **Label opinions** — clearly signal when a statement is judgment, synthesis, or forecast.
- **Cite facts** — provide APA in-text citations and supply a consolidated reference list at the end of the chapter.
- **Freshness** — for time-sensitive stats, use current credible data; if unavailable at drafting time, mark **[Writer to research latest topic]**.

### 5. Humor & Voice Color

- **Subtle playfulness. Subtle cleverness.**
- Use wit or a lightly ironic turn of phrase to energize a passage; never slip into silliness, slapstick, or sarcasm.

### 6. Prohibited Practices

- Anthropomorphizing AI (e.g., “the model thinks/feels/wants”).
- Over-explaining obvious terms to the intended professional audience.
- Excessive rhetorical questions or forced metaphors unless explicitly requested in the brief.

### 8. Compliance Check (to be used in every draft)

At the end of each generated section, the model must silently apply this checklist and revise once before delivering the final text:

- **Voice:** third-person, confident, plain-spoken, concise; **Style Anchor Card bound**.
- **Focus:** every sentence advances the argument, provides evidence, or strengthens arguments.
- **Evidence:** opinions labeled; facts cited per APA; freshness checked or **[Writer to research]** added where relevant.
- **Structure:** one declared hard shape followed end-to-end; final sentence is a verification or next action.
- **Devices:** none included unless explicitly activated by the brief.
- Lack of redundancy of the whole: Each sub-chapter is a unique component to the whole chapter and each flows into the next.
- Flowability of entire chapter: Entire chapter 

Only the revised text is returned.

### Integration Rule

When drafting:

1. Load **Style Baseline (Directive)**.
2. Load **Brand Pack (Author Compass)**.
3. Load the active **Chapter Brief** and any necessary **Sub-chapter Briefs**
4. Run the drafting process with the **Critic Loop** enforcing compliance.

USE ONLY AS STYLE EXAMPLES, NOT CONTENT
- AI has attracted trillions in investment and enthralled billions of people in just a few years since the public debut of what modern audiences regard as “AI”—ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5, released in November 2022). OpenAI reports that roughly 75% of ChatGPT dialogues involve practical guidance, information-seeking, or writing tasks (writing being the most common). Despite these pragmatic uses, many still treat it as a glorified search engine, pose it philosophical or psychological questions, or lean on it to polish emails (OpenAI, n.d.). But in truth, the tool becomes a force multiplier only when wielded deliberately: first by mastering its internal logic, then by sculpting prompts and context so as to command any desired output. By internalizing the principles in this book, individuals can shift from treating AI as a novelty to deploying it as a precise, high-IQ assistant—offloading routine tasks, orchestrating complex workflow automations, and sharpening decision-making to boost both consistency and the probability of success in *any* task.

- - **Excerpt 1:**  "Medical device cybersecurity is an issue of global, national, and even local concern. The world watched in 2020 as hospitals were rampaged with an influx of patients without a way to help the underlying causes of COVID-19. Medical devices sitting on the network were more vulnerable than ever and the necessary uptime of all medical devices was a stark 100%. As the rise of ransomware continued to plague hospitals, the realizations slowly became evident: Hospitals were simply not equipped to handle the sudden influx of sick patients, the changing threats of a digital age amid chaos, and how to change rapidly in a rapidly changing world. For instance, in only October of 2020 (6 months after the first official reporting of COVID-19) more than 6 hospitals had undergone cyber-attacks that completely altered operations and there was a seventy one percent rise in ransomware attacks on hospitals from September to October 2020 alone (O’Neil, 2020)."
- **Excerpt 2:**  "Moreover, it is not a mystery that actual cybercriminal activity is one of the least worries as it pertains to issues with cybersecurity. In other words, it is these internal drivers to the program that affects cybersecurity within organizations, not necessarily the specific attacks that threaten the industry. The problem is just as much internal (users, people, organizational structure) as it is external (attackers from outside the organization seeking to exfiltrate data). As a result, it is much more important to understand the key drivers, culture, risk appetite and the risk management framework that the healthcare system has, instead of just what technical solutions the program can offer. Defining the intangibles can often be more productive than defining how the security lacks specifically for a hospital system. Knowing that within a hospital’s culture a CEO's approval is more important than the CIO's approval for managing risk on a hospital network is an intangible that cannot be quantified; however, it could be the difference between an effective cybersecurity program and getting stopped just before the summit."

- **Excerpt 3:** "These examples give way to an important question: where does the healthcare system go from here? They know the problem, they know what roadblocks stand in their way to an effective security program, they see the impending difficulties ahead, they know their culture, so what is the solution? The solution is multi-faceted, as each hospital system faces nuances that are unique to itself, however, there are several practical solutions that can give way to a general outline for risk management for a hospital. These are: 1. Decide who is responsible for the healthcare system (HTM Staff, IT, Both, etc) and have that department take complete ownership, relying on other departments as needed. 2. Collect data. 3. Integrate the known vulnerabilities into the current risk management framework and decide action steps based on that risk management framework (if the system does not have a risk management framework, define the risk management framework for the hospital system using the threat modeling system below). 4. Work with manufacturers and hospital staff to mitigate, avoid, transfer, or accept the risks identified in step 3. Beyond the theoretical solutions, there are many practical solutions that teams can use to speed the process along and make the process more effective. There are modern technical solutions that do much of the grunt work for the individuals responsible. In all reality, passive monitoring tools can take an organization from no known vulnerabilities to all the known vulnerabilities on the network."
