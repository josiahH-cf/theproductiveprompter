## Purpose
Guarantee that every factual claim, quotation, and intellectual property reference in the book is accurate, current, legally compliant, and professionally formatted.  
This document provides the **citation and rights framework** the model must enforce whenever it drafts text.

---

## 1. Citation Standards

**Format**

- Use **APA 7th edition** style for all in-text citations and for the consolidated References section at the end of each chapter.
- Every in-text citation must have a corresponding full reference entry.

**Content Rules**

- **Facts and Statistics**: Cite credible, verifiable sources (peer-reviewed journals, major consulting firms, reputable industry reports, or recognized media).
- **Freshness**: For statistics or market data, always pull from the most current and credible sources at the time of drafting.
- **Live Links**: Include a clickable link where the publishing platform supports it (Kindle/EPUB3, companion website).

**If Data is Unavailable**

- When no credible source exists or data are incomplete, explicitly flag with a bracketed note for the human author, e.g.,  
  > “[Writer to research latest AI adoption statistics for 2025]”

**Common Knowledge Exemption**

- Widely accepted facts (e.g., “The Earth orbits the Sun,” “Alan Turing introduced the Turing Test in 1950”) require no citation, but borderline cases should err on the side of citing.

---

## 2. Reference List Requirements

- Compile a **single consolidated references section** at the end of each chapter.
- Arrange references alphabetically by author or, if no author, by the first significant word of the title.
- Use APA formatting for every reference entry, including DOIs or stable URLs when available.

---

## 3. Attribution of Third-Party Content

- **Quotations**: Use direct quotes sparingly; prefer paraphrasing with citations. If a direct quote is essential, reproduce it accurately and cite the exact page or timestamp.
- **Figures, tables, or diagrams**: Use only if they are public domain, under a compatible license, or explicitly permitted. Always credit the source.
- **Data sets**: If using a specific dataset, name it and provide access details or URLs if legally permissible.

---

## 4. Handling Trademarks & Franchises

- Use **neutral descriptive language** when referencing trademarks or fictional works (e.g., _Terminator_, _Star Trek_).
- Always **attribute ownership** where appropriate:  
  > “As illustrated by _Terminator_ (a property of StudioCanal and Skydance Media)…”
- Avoid implying any endorsement, partnership, or affiliation with rights holders.

---

## 5. Integration with the Drafting Process

- The **Critic Loop’s Evidence Check** enforces these standards after each draft section, ensuring:
  - All non-common-knowledge claims are cited.
  - Citations are in correct APA format.
  - Freshness and research gaps are explicitly handled.
- Chapter and Sub-chapter Briefs may request specific statistics or case studies; in all cases, citations must conform to this note.

---

## 6. Companion Website

Use the companion site [https://theproductiveprompter.com/](https://theproductiveprompter.com/) as the authoritative update hub for all time-sensitive or evolving references.

- **Longevity notes**: Maintain up-to-date statistics, key industry benchmarks, and emerging research findings that may change after publication.
- **Extended source material**: Host full references, long-form case studies, and supplementary tables where e-book formatting limits inline detail.

**Explicit referencing instruction**  
Whenever a statistic or claim is time-sensitive or likely to evolve (e.g., market adoption rates, regulatory changes), **add a direct in-text note for the reader** such as:  
> “For the latest information on global AI adoption statistics, visit theproductiveprompter.com.”
This callout must appear **within the main text** where the statistic is introduced and again as part of the consolidated references list to ensure readers know exactly where to find the current data.

---
## 7. Movement Preamble Additions (Required Updates)

Each drafting section must include:

- **Chosen Shape**: State the selected shape from Shape Set A.
- **Devices**: Narrative devices are OFF by default and only activate when a brief explicitly names the device and its purpose.
- **Freshness Gate**: For any time-sensitive claim, run a Research Pass for current citations or insert “[Writer to research]”.

## Quick Reference Checklist

Every drafted section must:

1. Include APA in-text citations for all non-common-knowledge claims.
2. Provide a complete, alphabetized APA references section.
3. Insert live links when the platform allows.
4. Attribute all trademarks, fictional works, or proprietary terms neutrally and accurately.
5. Flag research gaps clearly for the human author.
6. Where information is likely to become outdated, **explicitly instruct readers to consult the companion website**.
7. Declare and follow a single hard shape, ending with a verification or next-action sentence.
8. Ensure any narrative device is explicitly activated by name and purpose.
