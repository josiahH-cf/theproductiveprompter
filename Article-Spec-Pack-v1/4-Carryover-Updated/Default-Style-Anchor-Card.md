# Default Style Anchor Card

**Purpose:** Provide a default 100–150 word Style Anchor when article-specific anchor is not provided.

---

## Standard Style Anchor (General Articles)

Write with the clarity of a technical manual and the confidence of an experienced practitioner. Open with concrete claims backed by verifiable evidence. Use natural sentence variety—some punchy, some explanatory—averaging 16–22 words but never counting mechanically. Build arguments through accumulation: state the principle, show the proof, connect to reader impact. Favor active constructions and specific nouns. Let subtle wit energize the prose but never force it. Signal opinions clearly; present facts with credible linkable citations by default (APA only if a brief requires it). End sections with verification or next action, never philosophical musing. Every sentence must earn its place by advancing the idea, providing evidence, or setting up a transition.

**Word count:** 112 words  
**Status:** Approved for general use

## When to Use This Anchor

Use this default Style Anchor when:
- No article-specific Style Anchor is provided
- Article Brief doesn't specify tone modifications
- Topic is general/foundational (not highly specialized)

---

## When to Create Custom Anchor

Create a custom Style Anchor when:
- Article Brief requests specific tone (e.g., "more technical," "more accessible")
- Target audience differs significantly (e.g., C-suite vs. practitioners)
- Topic requires specialized voice (e.g., academic, conversational)

## How to Apply

During drafting (Phase 4):
1. Read this anchor before writing first paragraph
2. Internalize the cadence and lexicon patterns
3. Apply throughout article (Voice Check validates adherence)
4. Never output the anchor itself in the article

## Cadence Patterns from This Anchor

- **Opening pattern:** "Write with X and Y" (compound qualities)
- **Evidence pattern:** "State → Show → Connect" (three-step build)
- **Constraint pattern:** "Never X" (clear prohibition)
- **Purpose pattern:** "Must earn its place by..." (intentionality)

---

## Lexicon Patterns from This Anchor

- **Action verbs:** write, open, build, favor, signal, present, earn
- **Precision modifiers:** concrete, verifiable, natural, specific, subtle
- **Structural signals:** through accumulation, by advancing, never
- **Quality markers:** clarity, confidence, evidence, impact

## Voice Examples Demonstrating This Anchor

### Example 1: Opening with Concrete Claim
> "Structured prompts reduce ambiguous AI outputs by 40–60% compared to free-form requests, according to a 2024 study of 10,000 enterprise interactions (Chen et al., 2024). The difference comes down to explicit role specification, clear task framing, and constraint boundaries—three elements absent from most casual prompts."

**What this demonstrates:**
- Opens with verifiable fact + citation
- States percentage (concrete)
- Connects to reader impact ("the difference comes down to...")
- Sets up what follows (three elements)

### Example 2: Purposeful Sentence Economy
> "Every prompt has three jobs: define the role, scope the task, and set quality bars. Miss one and outputs drift. Miss two and you're guessing. Miss all three and the model becomes a creative writing partner, not a precision tool."

**What this demonstrates:**
- Punchy opening (10 words)
- Three-part structure (accumulation)
- Short consequence statements (sentence variety)
- Subtle wit ("creative writing partner")
- No filler—every clause advances the point

### Example 3: Ending with Verification
> "By applying role specification, context windowing, and iterative refinement, practitioners measured 60% fewer revision cycles and 40% faster time-to-final-output across 500 documented workflows (Martinez & Liu, 2024). Start with role, add context, refine once."

**What this demonstrates:**
- Ends with verification (measured outcomes + citation)
- Provides next action ("Start with role...")
- No maxim or philosophical statement
- Evidence → Action pattern

## Integration with Critic Loop

**Voice Check validates:**
- Cadence matches patterns above
- Lexicon uses action verbs and precision modifiers
- No drift into marketing speak or abstractions

**If Voice Check fails:**
- Identify drifted paragraphs
- Reread Style Anchor
- Rewrite to match cadence/lexicon patterns
- Re-check
