# Spec Quick Reference (31 Days of AI)

Use this as the lightweight drafting checklist. It is derived from:
- Article Spec Pack: Unified Article Spec (Narrative Arc)
- Style Baseline (Directive)
- Meta-Prompt (final rewrite / QA)

## Non-Negotiables

- Write for busy, competent professionals (developer voice).
- Anti-hype, pragmatic, concrete.
- No anthropomorphizing (“the model thinks/wants”). Prefer “the system predicts/optimizes/generates.”
- No internal framework headers or labels.

## Narrative Arc (Not a Template)

Flow: **Concrete problem → Conceptual reframing → Practical application → Closure**

Vary order/sectioning per topic. Combine or omit sections if they would be filler.

## Forbidden Public Headers

Do not use these as verbatim H2s:
- The Reality Check / Reality Check
- Mental Models
- The Workflow / Workflow
- Caution
- Tri-Stage Checklist
- Closing Activation

Write topic-specific headers.

## Rhetorical Hygiene

Avoid lazy contrast:
- “It’s not X, it’s Y.”
- “This isn’t X. It’s Y.”

If you want contrast, **prove it** via:
- comparison table
- before/after
- small scenario

## Factual Specificity Gate (Remove Dubious Specifics)

If you cannot cite a reputable source, do **not** publish precise:
- numbers, dates, “as of” claims
- version numbers
- token counts

Rewrite to bounded uncertainty (“providers vary”, “check vendor docs”).

## Workflows

Each workflow must include:
- trigger (when)
- mechanism (prompt/code)
- verification (how to check)

Do not use fixed labels like “When/Why/Pattern/Steps”. Write it naturally.

## Variation Knobs (Pick 2–3 Per Article)

- Opener type: micro-story, scenario, artifact (log/prompt/diff), failure moment.
- Proof style: table, before/after, counterexample, case study.
- Workflow presentation: narrative case study vs structured blocks.
- Closing type: verification, warning, callback, question, next action.
