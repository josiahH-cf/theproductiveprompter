**Date:** 2025-11-14  
**Article:** The Professional's Playbook: 4 Copy-Paste AI Prompts That Actually Work

## Checks Performed

- Aligned content with `Unified-Article-Spec.md` and `Article-Master-Spec.md`.
- Verified second-person practitioner voice and anti-hype tone throughout.
- Confirmed structure: opening reality check → 4 workflow blocks (Alex/Maya/Leo/Sam) → CRIT explainer → activation/next steps → further reading.
- Ensured each role section includes vignette → template → anatomy breakdown → "How to adapt this template" tips.
- Strengthened guardrails with:
  - Upfront educational disclaimer and trademark note.
  - "Verify like a professional" instruction in the action section.
- Checked that the final call to action is a concrete next step, not an aphorism.
- Confirmed no internal scaffolding terms (Device, Gate, Shape, Style Anchor, Critic Loop, etc.) appear in public text.

## Notes

- Article currently references internal frameworks only (CRIT) and series articles; no external studies cited, so no APA references required at this time.
- Ready for publication or integration into your packaging/publishing workflow.
