# Drafting Notes — 14 Nov 2025

- Loaded precedence chain (Style Baseline, Brand Pack, Article Master Spec, Article Brief) before drafting.
- Activated required planning behaviors from the brief: opening "Meet the Team" vignette, Terminator myth Q&A, ANI/AGI/ASI comparison table, prompt template before/after, "Two Analysts" urgency vignette, closing bridge to deterministic vs. probabilistic systems.
- Incorporated 2024 adoption data from McKinsey and Stanford HAI plus foundational Turing citation.
- Drafted full article in `article.md`, applied silent Critic Loop (voice, focus, evidence), verified final-line next action, and ensured no scaffolding terms appear in public text.
