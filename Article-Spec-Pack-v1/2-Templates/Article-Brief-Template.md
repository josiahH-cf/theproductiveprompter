# Article Brief Template

**Purpose**  
This template provides the minimal, article-scale brief used to guide public-facing, developer-oriented articles. It defines objectives, scope, audience, and freshness expectations. Devices are planning aids only; do not expose device labels in public text.

---

## Instructions

Fill out each section with clear, actionable directives. This brief is binding and takes precedence over general guidance when article-specific decisions are needed.

**Precedence position:** After the consolidated Article Spec and Style Baseline, and alongside the Brand Pack.

---

## 1. Article Metadata

**Title:**  
[Working title of the article]

**Intended Audience:**  
Developers and technically fluent AI users (be specific about role/stack/experience level)

**Publication Context:**  
[Where/how this article will be published — e.g., companion site, standalone piece, supplement to book]

**Estimated Scope:**  
[Brief description of article boundaries — what's included, what's excluded]

---

## 2. Objective & Scope

**Objective:**  
State the transformation or takeaway in 1–2 sentences. What workflow, prompt pattern, or decision rule will the reader be able to apply?

**Scope:**  
[Define boundaries explicitly:
- What topics/questions this article addresses
- What is intentionally excluded
- Depth vs. breadth balance]

**Constraints:**  
Length (approx. 1,500–2,500 words); second-person developer voice; linkable citations by default (APA only if required); no internal scaffolding terms in public text.

**Required Blocks (for article parity with reference style):**
- 2–3 mental models (brief, utility-first)
- 3–5 workflow blocks using “When / Why / Pattern / Steps,” each with a tight prompt snippet (role, objective, constraints, success criteria)
- Caution section: “What not to outsource to AI” (security, architecture, compliance, unreviewed code)
- Tri-stage checklist: Before / During / After

---

## 3. Core Argument

**Central Thesis:**  
[The single, unambiguous claim this article makes. One sentence.]

**Supporting Claims:**  
[List 2–5 key claims that build toward or support the thesis. Use bullet points.]

- Claim 1
- Claim 2
- Claim 3

---

## 4. Planning Aids (Internal Behaviors)

If you want specific narrative behaviors, specify them here as internal planning notes. They must be rendered naturally in the article with no labels.

- Scenario/vignette: [What situation to open with; purpose]
- Q&A subheading: [Key question to answer succinctly]
- Comparison table: [Columns/rows; purpose]
- Prompt plate: [Before/after prompt and measurable outcome]
- Decision checklist: [Steps/branches to guide the reader]
- Workflow blocks: [List the workflows to include; each must follow When/Why/Pattern/Steps]

---

## 5. Freshness Expectations

**Default:** Freshness is **dynamic** and topic-specific; avoid stale statistics.

**Instructions:** Define freshness requirements based on the nature of the content.

**Time-Sensitive Topics:**  
[List any topics where data/claims evolve rapidly and require current sources]

- Topic 1: [Required freshness — e.g., "Use sources from past 6 months"]
- Topic 2: [Required freshness]

**Stable Topics:**  
[List any topics where older authoritative sources are acceptable]

- Topic 1: [Acceptable source age — e.g., "Foundational research from any period"]

**Research Gaps:**  
[List any areas where sources may be incomplete or evolving. Flag for bracketed notes if needed.]

**Companion-Site Policy:**  
If a stat may age quickly, prefer describing the trend and link to an updated source. Avoid “Note on Longevity” callouts in public text unless explicitly required by the Brief.

---

## 6. Success Criteria

**Evaluation Checks:**  
[How will you know this article succeeded? List 3–5 specific criteria.]

- [ ] Criterion 1: [e.g., "Reader can identify three common prompt errors"]
- [ ] Criterion 2: [e.g., "Article includes at least two real-world examples with citations"]
- [ ] Criterion 3: [e.g., "Final section provides actionable next steps"]
- [ ] Criterion 4
- [ ] Criterion 5

**Quality Benchmarks:**  
Any specific targets beyond the consolidated spec (e.g., “Include a before/after prompt with a measured outcome,” “Show a minimal diff for one refactor step”).

---

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

**Risks:**  
[Potential pitfalls, challenges, or areas requiring careful handling]

- Risk 1: [e.g., "Topic is rapidly evolving; sources may become stale quickly"]
- Risk 2: [e.g., "Audience expertise varies widely; balance detail vs. accessibility"]

**Assumptions:**  
[What you're assuming about readers, context, or available evidence]

- Assumption 1: [e.g., "Readers have basic familiarity with prompt engineering"]
- Assumption 2: [e.g., "Access to current industry reports is available"]

---

## 8. Integration Notes

**Cross-References:**  
[List any other articles, book chapters, or resources this article should reference or link to]

**Tone Adjustments:**  
[Any article-specific voice modifications within Style Baseline constraints — e.g., "More technical," "Include more examples," "Emphasize practical over theoretical"]

**Special Instructions:**  
[Any other directive not covered above]

---

## Quick Reference: What This Brief Controls

- **Internal behaviors:** Planning aids that shape natural content (no labels in public text)
- **Freshness horizons:** Dynamic, topic-specific expectations defined in Section 5
- **Success criteria:** Practical, reader-oriented outcomes
- **Scope boundaries:** Explicit inclusion/exclusion to prevent scope creep
- **Precedence:** Must align with the consolidated Article Spec and Style Baseline
