# Article Queue (General)

Use this file as a lightweight backlog for **non-campaign** article work.

Guidelines
- Keep `0-Article-Content/` (root) for actual intake drafts only.
- Store planning docs (like this queue) under `0-Article-Content/_meta/`.
- If you’re running a special campaign (like 31 Days of AI), archive that campaign queue under `9-Archive/` when it’s done.
